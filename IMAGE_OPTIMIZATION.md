# Image Loading Optimization Guide

This document describes the image loading and rendering optimizations implemented in PolyDraw.

## Overview

The application now uses modern browser APIs to optimize loading and rendering of images, especially large files. The system automatically processes images off the main thread and resizes them when necessary.

## Key Features

### 1. Web Worker Processing
- Images are decoded using a dedicated Web Worker to prevent UI blocking
- Uses the `createImageBitmap` API for efficient image decoding
- Transferable objects minimize memory overhead
- Automatic fallback to main thread if Web Workers aren't available

### 2. Automatic Image Resizing
- Images exceeding 4096×4096 pixels are automatically resized
- Maintains aspect ratio while reducing dimensions
- Uses high-quality resizing algorithm (`resizeQuality: 'high'`)
- Notifies users when images are resized with before/after dimensions

### 3. Progressive Loading
- Real-time progress feedback during image processing
- Visual loading indicator with percentage display
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Non-blocking UI during image upload

### 4. Hardware Acceleration
- Canvas rendering uses GPU acceleration via `transform-gpu` class
- Optimized canvas context configuration with `desynchronized: true`
- High-quality image smoothing enabled
- Async image decoding with `decoding="async"`

### 5. Memory Management
- ImageBitmap objects are properly closed after use
- Efficient memory transfer between worker and main thread
- Old images are removed from DOM before loading new ones

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
src/
├── workers/
│   └── imageProcessor.worker.ts    # Web Worker for image processing
├── utils/
│   └── imageLoader.ts               # Image loading utilities
├── components/
│   └── UI/
│       ├── LoadingIndicator.tsx    # Progress indicator
│       └── ImageResizeNotification.tsx  # Resize notification
└── hooks/
    └── useCanvas.ts                 # Updated with new loading system
```

### Image Processing Flow

1. **Upload**: User selects an image file
2. **Worker Check**: System checks if Web Workers are available
3. **Processing**:
   - File is read as ArrayBuffer
   - Converted to Blob
   - Decoded using `createImageBitmap`
   - Resized if dimensions exceed 4096px
4. **Transfer**: ImageBitmap transferred to main thread
5. **Rendering**: Converted to HTMLImageElement and added to canvas
6. **Cleanup**: ImageBitmap closed to free memory

### Configuration

Maximum image dimensions are set in `useCanvas.ts`:
```typescript
const result = await loadImageOptimized(file, {
  maxWidth: 4096,
  maxHeight: 4096,
  onProgress: (progress) => {
    // Progress callback
  }
});
```

## Browser Compatibility

- **Web Workers**: All modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **createImageBitmap**: Supported in all major browsers
- **Fallback**: Automatic fallback to main thread processing if Web Workers unavailable

## Performance Benefits

- **Non-blocking UI**: Image processing doesn't freeze the interface
- **Faster decoding**: `createImageBitmap` is optimized for performance
- **Reduced memory**: Large images are automatically resized
- **Smooth experience**: Progressive loading with visual feedback

## Testing

The system includes automatic fallback for test environments (jsdom) that don't support Web Workers. All existing tests continue to pass with the new implementation.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for consideration:
- Thumbnail generation for very large images
- Image format conversion (WebP, AVIF)
- Chunked rendering for extreme resolutions
- Image caching system
- Multiple image queue management
