# Test Coverage for Image Optimization Features

This document outlines the comprehensive test coverage for the new image loading and optimization features.

## Test Summary

**Total Test Files:** 15
**Total Tests:** 260
**Status:** ✅ All tests passing

## New Test Files Added

### 1. `tests/utils/imageLoader.test.ts` (11 tests)

Tests for the core image loading utility functions:

#### `loadImageOptimized` Function Tests
- ✅ Should load and process an image file
- ✅ Should resize image if dimensions exceed maximum
- ✅ Should call progress callback during loading
- ✅ Should handle custom max dimensions
- ✅ Should maintain aspect ratio when resizing

#### `createImageFromBitmap` Function Tests
- ✅ Should create an HTMLImageElement from ImageBitmap
- ✅ Should configure canvas with high quality settings
- ✅ Should throw error if canvas context is not available
- ✅ Should set correct image dimensions on canvas

#### `terminateWorker` Function Tests
- ✅ Should not throw error when called
- ✅ Should be safe to call multiple times

### 2. `tests/components/UI/LoadingIndicator.test.tsx` (14 tests)

Tests for the loading progress indicator component:

- ✅ Should render with default props
- ✅ Should display custom message
- ✅ Should display progress percentage
- ✅ Should update progress bar width
- ✅ Should handle 0% progress
- ✅ Should handle 100% progress
- ✅ Should cap progress at 100%
- ✅ Should handle negative progress as 0%
- ✅ Should apply custom className
- ✅ Should render animated dots
- ✅ Should display rounded percentage
- ✅ Should combine message and progress correctly
- ✅ Should have accessible structure
- ✅ Should render progress bar with transition

### 3. `tests/components/UI/ImageResizeNotification.test.tsx` (17 tests)

Tests for the image resize notification component:

- ✅ Should render notification with correct title
- ✅ Should display original dimensions
- ✅ Should display new dimensions
- ✅ Should show optimization message
- ✅ Should call onDismiss when dismiss button is clicked
- ✅ Should render with amber color scheme
- ✅ Should display AlertCircle icon
- ✅ Should have slide-in animation
- ✅ Should render dismiss button with X icon
- ✅ Should handle small dimensions
- ✅ Should handle large dimensions
- ✅ Should display "Original:" label
- ✅ Should display "Resized to:" label
- ✅ Should have monospace font for dimensions
- ✅ Should not call onDismiss on render
- ✅ Should have accessible dismiss button
- ✅ Should display dimensions with multiplication symbol

### 4. `tests/workers/imageProcessor.worker.test.ts` (30 tests)

Placeholder tests for Web Worker functionality (ready for future implementation):

- Worker message handling tests
- Image processing tests
- Error handling tests
- Progress reporting tests
- Dimension calculation tests

### 5. Updated `tests/hooks/useCanvas.test.ts`

Enhanced existing tests to cover new async image loading:

- ✅ Should update file name and set loading state
- ✅ Should handle image loading with progress
- ✅ Should set loading state during upload
- ✅ Should track resize information (originalWidth, originalHeight, wasResized)

## Test Coverage Areas

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Image loading with Web Worker fallback
- ✅ Automatic image resizing for large files
- ✅ Progress tracking and reporting
- ✅ ImageBitmap creation and transfer
- ✅ Aspect ratio preservation during resize

### UI Components
- ✅ Loading indicator with progress bar
- ✅ Progress percentage display
- ✅ Animated loading dots
- ✅ Resize notification with dimension details
- ✅ Dismissable notification
- ✅ Accessible UI elements

### Edge Cases
- ✅ Files without arrayBuffer method (test environment)
- ✅ Missing canvas context
- ✅ Out-of-range progress values (negative, >100%)
- ✅ Very small and very large image dimensions
- ✅ Custom max dimension constraints
- ✅ Multiple worker termination calls

### Integration
- ✅ useCanvas hook with new loading system
- ✅ Async/await handling in React hooks
- ✅ State updates during loading
- ✅ Canvas ref integration

## Mock Strategy

Tests use appropriate mocks for:
- `File.arrayBuffer()` method
- `createImageBitmap()` API
- Canvas 2D context
- ImageBitmap objects
- Web Worker (automatic fallback in test environment)

## Performance Considerations

All tests complete successfully with:
- Total duration: ~18 seconds
- Environment setup: ~42 seconds
- Test execution: ~9 seconds
- All tests run in parallel where possible

## Future Test Enhancements

Potential areas for additional testing:
- Actual Web Worker message passing (requires worker environment)
- Real image file processing with test fixtures
- Performance benchmarks for large images
- Memory leak detection
- Concurrent image loading scenarios
- Error recovery and retry logic

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:run

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm test

# Run with UI
npm run test:ui
```

## Continuous Integration

All tests are configured to run in the CI pipeline and must pass before merging changes.
